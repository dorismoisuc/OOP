You decide to use the technique called DynamicVector defined by you, from which mana does not leak. Make sure to (unit) test everything.

  All enchantments must take the form:

    mode X (e.g. mode A)
    add title, type, lastPerformed, timesPerformed, vision (eg. add cleanup, merchant room clean spill, 01-13-1248, 5, sparkling room)
    update title, newType, newLastPerformed, newTimesPerformed, newVision (eg. update cleanup, merchant room bring bathwater, 01-14-1248, 14, bathing patron)
    delete title (eg. delete cleanup)
    list
    exit

LAB6:
  "You decide to use higher form of DynamicVector that which uses runes of template! All enchantments must take the form:

          next
          save title (eg. save cleanup)
          list type, timesPerformed (list merchant room clean spill, 5)
          mylist
